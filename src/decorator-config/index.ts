/**
 * @module
 * @description
 * The `decorator-config` module in Active-Connect provides a `DecoratorConfig` class that can be used to store details for a decorated method and a decorable function. The `DecoratorConfig` class allows developers to wrap the target and propertyKey into an object and access a singleton version of the target object within all decorated methods of a class.
 *
 * **Note:** The `decorator-config` module is used internally by Active-Connect and is not typically needed for usual external use cases.
