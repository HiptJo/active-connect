/**

 * @description
 * The `json` module in Active-Connect exports a JSON parser that is specifically designed to parse received WebSocket messages and other JSON data within smart web-based projects.
 * This JSON parser provides reliable and efficient parsing capabilities, allowing developers to seamlessly handle JSON data during real-time communication with clients and the server.
 *
 * Please note that the `json` module is typically not needed for usual use cases, as most modern programming environments natively support JSON parsing. However, it serves as a valuable utility for specific scenarios where fine-tuned JSON parsing is necessary.
